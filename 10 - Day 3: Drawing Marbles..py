# ===================================

# The solution is pretty straightforward. Adter the first drawning of the red ball, the number of balls in the bag will be 6. Therefore, the probability of drawning a blue ball now will equal 
# the ratio of the number of blue balls in the bag and the number of total balls in the bag, which equates to

1. P(A) = 2/3

# where A is defined as

2. A ={(R,B)}

# for R being the Red ball drawning event and B the blue one.
