#   Problem statement & information
# ===================================

# There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z.
#
# • Urn X contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
# • Urn Y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
# • Urn Z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls.
#
# One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

#              Solution
# ===================================

# The solution consists in counting all the possible distinct combination of outcomes for which given 3 balls drawns, 2 are red and 1 in black from the sample set 

1. S ={{R,B} x {R,B} x {R,B}}

# The only possible outcomes satisfying the above constraint, given the sample set S, will be given by the set

2. A = {(R,R,B), (R,B,R), (B,R,R)} 

# where the elements of the set A follow the notation (X,Y,Z). For each urn the probabilities of drawning a red or a black ball are

3. • Urn X -----> Red ball = 4/7 and Black ball = 3/7
   • Urn Y -----> Red ball = 5/9 and Black ball = 4/9
   • Urn Z -----> Red ball = 1/2 and Black ball = 1/2

# The probability for each outcome in the set A will be equal to the product of the probability of drawning the desidered colored ball. As a result one has

4. • (R,R,B) -----> 4/7 * 5/9 * 1/2 = 10/63
   • (R,B,R) -----> 4/7 * 4/9 * 1/2 = 8/63
   • (B,R,R) -----> 3/7 * 5/9 * 1/2 = 15/126

# The probability of the set A will be the sum of all the probabilities of each outcome in the set A, therefore we get the final answer

5. P(A) = 10/63 + 8/63 + 15/126 = 17/42
